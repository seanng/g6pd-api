# Modules

This directory contains the core feature modules of the application.

Each subdirectory represents a distinct functional area or domain (e.g., `health`, `users`, `products`).

Modules typically encapsulate routes, services, data transfer objects (DTOs), interfaces, and tests related to that specific feature, promoting modularity and separation of concerns.

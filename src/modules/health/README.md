# Health Module

This module provides the `/health` endpoint for monitoring the application's status.

## Components

- `health.service.ts`: Contains the `HealthService` class, responsible for checking dependencies (currently placeholder) and assembling the health status object.
- `health.route.ts`: Defines the Hono sub-router for the `/health` path and uses `HealthService` to respond to requests.
- `health.service.test.ts`: Unit tests for `HealthService`.
- `health.route.test.ts`: Tests for the `/health` route handler.
